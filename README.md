#Order Parser

Hello love. This project is a little more complicated than the previous projects. 

This is your readme file. You can find and edit it as you'd like in the root of the project.

In order to get this project up and running on your work machine, you're going to want to navigate to your projects directory. When you ls you should see both your morawareautomation and your pinterestproject directories. From here you are going to run 

$	git clone https://github.com/AshleyBashley/RyanNVR.git

Then CD into the directory

$	cd RyanNVR

and you have a few gems to install

$	gem install awesome_print
$	gem install gem install pdf-reader

Now you can run the project with 

$	ruby processPDFs.rb

It won't have any PDFs to process, but it will generate the PDFs_RYAN/ directory.

$	ls

You can put the PDFs to process in there and everything should work out of the box with  

$	ruby processPDFs.rb

If you want to make changes, add fields, or set up the NV one I left comments throughout processPDFs.rb to help you out.


If you run into any problems just skype me <3
